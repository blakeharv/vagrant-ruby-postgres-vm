Sweet Rails VM with Postgres 9.1, Ruby 2.0, and ZSH

Don't mess around with wonky local development setups for Rails. Use a sweet VM to streamline your workflow.

## Features
- Use Postgres for your local DB. Great for deploying to Heroku
- Sets you up with a fresh development database ready for Rails
- Sets up RVM, Bundler, and Ruby-2.0.0
- Configures zsh + vcprompt (displays git branch info) for a better console experience
- Use a shared folder to keep your codebase repo separate from the VM repo
- NFS folder sharing helps keep your tests fast
- Configuration options to speed up your VM
